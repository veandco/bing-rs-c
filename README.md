# Bing C

This repository consists of a C header file and an example program for using the library generated by [bing-rs](https://github.com/veandco/bing-rs).

To run the example, you will need to build [bing-rs](https://github.com/veandco/bing-rs) and copy the library (e.g. `libbing_rs.so`) to here. You should also set the `SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` in the `example.c` file. After that, run `make`.
